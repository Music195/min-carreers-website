            Handwriting is something that may be far away from a lot of people in todayâ€™s digitalized 
            world thanks to various electronic devices, and it is not strange that we have to meet up
            with the boring Times New Roman or Verdana at most times, even receiving a greeting card. 
            So why not give a try on some handwriting fonts? In fact, there are some advantages of 
            using handwriting fonts. Firstly, handwriting fonts add a personal touch, which is true 
            especially when you are sending cards, invitations using them. Secondly, handwriting fonts 
            will attract the eye. Imagine using a handwriting font instead of web-safe fonts like Arial,
            Times New Roman for your blog titles, post titles etc, you will surely catch the eyes of 
            your readers.
